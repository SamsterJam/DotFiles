# DotFiles

Welcome to my DotFiles repository! This repository contains all my personal configuration files and system settings that I use across my systems. These dotfiles are primarily intended to be used with my other project, [JamInstaller](https://github.com/SamsterJam/JamInstaller), which automates the setup process and customizes the environment using these files.


## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized collection of my configuration files, which can be cloned or referenced by JamInstaller at the end of the installation process. This ensures a consistent and personalized setup across all my systems.


## Credits

Many of these configuration files are modified, adapted, or prearranged versions from [Archcraft](https://github.com/adi1090x), such as the Polybar and Rofi configurations. The BSPWM and SXHKD configurations were originally from Archcraft but have been heavily customized over the years to suit my preferences.



## Usage

Currently, there is no standalone installer for these dotfiles for existing systems. They are designed to be used by JamInstaller, which places everything in the correct locations. However, feel free to explore and copy any file contents for your own use. Please note that this repository has not been optimized or cleaned up for a professional release.



## License

This repository is open-source. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the files as you see fit.
